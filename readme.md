## About the Game

The Game is a Rogue-Like Card Collecting Game, where you choose between different Characters.  
Those have different starting decks and have different Powers and Weaknesses.

You must go on a Quest to save the People from the Evil Dragon-Lord.  
But walk carefully, because there are Enemies hidden all over the World - or maybe some treasures??

Have fun :)
